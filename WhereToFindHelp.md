# Other SQLForce Information Sites #

The blog, [The Programming Farmer](http://gsmithfarmer.blogspot.com/), contains lots of examples of how to use the Jython SQLForce module. When I encounter a Salesforce problem that is easily solved with Jython I generally post the solution with commentary on this site.
